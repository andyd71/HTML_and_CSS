<summary>The History of LFC</summary>
<p>Dalglish was appointed as player-manager after Fagan resigned <br>
following the 1985 Heysel Stadium disaster, which resulted in Liverpool's<br>
 indefinite ban from European competition. Liverpool won a league <br>
 and FA Cup double in Dalglish's first season, and won a further league<br>
 title in 1987–88. The Hillsborough disaster, which occurred during an<br>
 FA Cup semi-final against Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium <br>
 in April 1989, resulted in the deaths of 96 of the club's supporters.<br>
 After the disaster, Dalglish led the club to their eighteenth title,<br>
 in 1989–90; he resigned in February 1991. The Taylor Report into<br>
 the disaster recommended the end of standing terraces; to comply <br>
 with its findings, Anfield was converted to an all-seater stadium<br>
 during the early 1990s, which greatly reduced its capacity.<br>
 Dalglish's successor Graeme Souness won the FA Cup in his first <br>
 full season. In the newly formed Premier League, he struggled to<br>
 sustain the club's domestic successes and was replaced by Roy Evans<br>
 midway through 1993–94. Liverpool improved to fourth the following <br>
 season and won the League Cup.</p>
