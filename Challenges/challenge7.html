 <h2>The hover affect</h2>

 <p>Boris Johnson has survived an embarrassing Tory revolt and<br>
     for support to push new lockdown restrictions through the Commons.
    The new measures will come into force at midnight Mr Johnson<br>
     won the backing of MPs in the House of Commons.
    The latest shutdown due to last four weeks and end on December 2.
    MPs backed the second lockdown by 516 votes to 38.
    Pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops will close at midnight tonight.
    But a shift back to the tiered system when restrictions end could mean<br> 
    that many businesses are unable to reopen, depending on in which alert zone<br> 
    areas are placed.
